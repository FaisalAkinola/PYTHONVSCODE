# Conditional Statements:

# 1. Write a Python program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero and prints the result.

# 2. Create a Python function that takes two numbers as input and prints the greater number. If the numbers are equal, print "Both numbers are equal".

# 3. Write a Python script that asks the user for their age and prints "Eligible to vote" if they are 18 or older. Otherwise, it prints "Not eligible to vote".

# 4. Write a Python program that checks if a year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

# 5. Create a Python program that accepts a student's score as input and prints "Pass" if the score is 50 or higher and "Fail" otherwise.

# 6. Write a Python script to add two lists element-wise. For example, given lists `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]`, the result should be `[5, 7, 9]`.

# 7. Create a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the second largest number.

# 8. Write a Python program to merge two dictionaries and display the result. If there are duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary should overwrite the first.

# 9. Write a Python function that takes a list of words and returns a dictionary where the keys are the words and the values are the lengths of the words.

# 10. Create a Python script to remove duplicates from a list and return a sorted list of unique elements.
